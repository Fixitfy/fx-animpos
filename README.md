# Fixitfy Animation Position Menu

## Introduction

The **Fixitfy Animation Position Menu** is a powerful tool designed for players who want to precisely adjust their character's position and orientation during animations. This script is especially useful in role-playing (RP) servers or for players who enjoy working with animations. It allows for fine-tuning of animation positions, enabling players to move freely around their character and settle into the perfect spot.

## Features

- **Dynamic Position Adjustment:** Players can use the W, A, S, D keys to move their character forward, backward, left, or right during an animation. The character's orientation can be continuously adjusted while the animation is active.

- **Height Control:** Use the Q and E keys to move the character up or down relative to the ground level. This is particularly useful for precisely placing the character on specific surfaces or platforms.

- **Real-Time Visual Feedback:** As the player adjusts the animation position, the character fades in and out with an alpha value ranging from 0 to 255, creating a heartbeat-like effect. This visual cue helps players track their movements more easily.

- **Simple Usage:** Open the animation menu with the `/animpos` command and make your adjustments. Once satisfied, press the ENTER key to save the position, or press ESC to return to the starting position.

- **Mouse-Controlled Orientation:** By pressing the ALT key, players can activate mouse control to adjust the character's orientation using the mouse. This feature is particularly useful for achieving precise and aesthetic animation placements.

## Installation

1. **Setup:**
   - Place the `fx-animpos` folder directly into your `resources` folder.
   - Add `ensure fx-animpos` to your `server.cfg` file to start the script.
   - Select VORP or RSG in the `config.lua` file for notifications.

2. **Usage:**
   - Enter an animation and then use the `/animpos` command to open the animation menu. Adjust your position, and press ENTER to save the position. The character will then move to the specified location.

With the **Fixitfy Animation Position Menu**, you can place your characters more aesthetically, precisely, and creatively! This tool is the perfect addition to enhance your animation experience on any RedM server.
